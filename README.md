# mac-setup
This repo will contain info on the apps / tools / settings I use on my Mac.

## Install Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) allows us to install tools and apps from the command line.

To install it, open up the built in Terminal app and run this command:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

## Install commonly used apps (Casks)
`xargs brew install < brew-casks.txt`

## Install commonly used formulae
`xargs brew install < brew-formulae.txt`
